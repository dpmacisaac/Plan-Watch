# General Idea

The idea for this project is to create a firefox extension that allows the user to schedule when they want to watch a youtube video. 

# Goal
Create a tool that allows the user to manage their time online but forcing them to schedule videos to watch rather than continuously be able to watch videos

# Functions
- Block videos
- Add videos to different watchlists
- Set when those watchlists are viewable
- Unblock those videos during the watchlists open times
